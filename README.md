# Cub3D

In this project, In collaboration with my team, we designed and implemented a 2D raycasting game in the
C programming language. Raycasting is a technique used to render a 3D perspective effect in a 2D
environment, often seen in classic first-person shooter games like Wolfenstein 3D. The goal of this project
is to create a simplified version of such a game, where the player navigates through a maze-like world,
rendering the environment using raycasting techniques
